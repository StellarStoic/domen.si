# The Most Overdone Personal Website Ever! :rocket:

Hey there, internet traveler! this is the README of my personal website, where you'll find enough information to write a short biography, but probably too much information for anyone not looking to impersonate me. :laughing:


## Introduction

Hi, I'm the guy behind the website, a Senior Millennial, hobbyist coder, and tech enthusiast! This personal website is my playground, my canvas, and my digital virtual "diary" just because I have some time to overthink!

## Humor Corner :clown_face:

Mitch walks into my website.

Mitch: "Hey, what's this? A website or an encyclopedia?"
Me: "Why not both?"
Mitch: "I don't have time to read 'War and Peace' about your life!"
Me: "That's why I've made it interactive! You can click on words, man. WORDS!"
Mitch: "Click on words? What happens? Do they explode?"
Me: "No, they take you to even more information!"
Mitch: "Oh, great, a rabbit hole. Just what I needed."
Me: "Come on, you can even listen to bird songs!"
Mitch: "Bird songs? What is this, a Disney movie? Am I gonna find Bambi next?"
Me: "Hmm, not a bad idea for the next update."
Mitch: "I was joking!"
Me: "And I was taking notes."

## Tech Stack :computer:

Computer with some flavor, mouse with a mouse pad and a computer monitor or two. It's like the Neapolitan ice cream of web development!

## Why So Much? :thinking:

Why did I pack my website with more features than a Swiss Army knife? Because I was trying some latest technologies :grinning:

That's all, folks! If you've got a few more minutes, why not dive into the site? And if you get lost, don't worry. There's probably a modal for that.
